# PyBer_Analysis

## Using Python and Pandas to discover key differences in city type for the PyBer company

## Overview of the analysis-

We compared the different types of cities for the number of rides and the amount of revenue generated to give to the executives at the company.

### Results: differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types-

To understand what we are looking at, here is a graph that shows at a high level where revenue is being generated seperated by city type for the time period from January 1st 2019 to April 29th 2019:

This next figure shows a detailed account of the revenue broken down with city type, number of rides, averages per Ride and averages per Driver.

From this image you can see the differences in the Total Fares and number of rides between the city types is quite dramatic.

The Rural community by far is the lowest source of revinue.  This could be for a number of reasons.  They may not have a high need for this service or they have not been introduced to the advantages of using PyBer for transportation services.

The Suburban community seems to be the "sweet" spot for the average fare, more than doubling the average fares while having only 38% of the volume of rides of the Urban community.

### Summary: Based on the results, here are my recommendations for addressing the disparities  in revenue and number of rides per city type-

* Survey the Rural communities currently utilizing our services to determine need and      awareness of PyBer depending on the results we may need to increase advertising to target the Rural market

* Since the margins are more favorable, increase recruiting and advertising in the Rural and Suburban markets to leverage the longer trips and average fares

* Offer incentives and bonuses to Urban drivers to accept more Rural and Suburban fares
